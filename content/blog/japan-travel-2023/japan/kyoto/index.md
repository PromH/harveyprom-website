### Temples galore

We've reached Kyoto in the afternoon after multiple trains, a bus ride, and walking with all our luggage. 

Our AirBnb in Kyoto this time was a whole Japanese house to ourselves. It was pretty cool but also much less space compared to a normal Australian house. The place had a bunch of old dolls as well and accessing the toilet required you to get out of the house to go to like a dunny in the backyard. Still, it was a cool experience.

After dropping our stuff off, we explored a local temple area there, called Toji Temple. We saw a swastika logo on a shrine which is weird but apparently it's not associated with nazis. Rather, it's used to mark the location of Buddhist temples. Fun fact.

We also went and explored an art gallery being hosted inside of one of the buildings of the temple. We weren't allowed to take any photos but the art that they were showcasing iridescence paintings which makes the paintings appear in different colours depending on where you observe it from.

As we got out of the exhibition, we noticed that buses have arrived with more people outside the temple. Seems like there was going to be an event in the evening and to come back later for it.

### Window shopping but actually buying things - so actually shopping

We totally forgot about the event at Toji temple because we were so entranced from window shopping. 

First, we went to a Toys "R" Us because they don't exist anymore in Australia so had to check that out. It was nothing special and was just like visiting one in Australia back when they were still there.

Next up was a book store in Aeon Mall. The store was quite big and had a lot of variety of books to explore, though most of them where in Japanese. It sold manga and video game books as well which was pretty neat, had a lot of official artwork for From Software games but I had no room in my luggage to buy them and them back with me unfortunately. A peculiar thing we've noticed is that there's an 18+ section which was between two shelves where the entrances were just covered by curtains that anyone could just walk through. We didn't buy anything from the book store but Stephen was really interested in a Japanese cookbook that was in the top selling section, even though, it was all in Japanese. Stephen ended up buying the book later from a different book store.

A golf shop that was nearby was the next place we visited. Nothing particularly interesting of note there besides how some of the sporting goods there seemed to be matching Australian prices.

For dinner, we went to a quiet ramen restaurant before continuing the evening with more shopping. This time, we went to Don Quijote to buy alcohol and snacks to have while we hung out at our AirBnb. We bought a bunch of random fruity drinks to sample which included a tomato beer. They also were selling spirytus but because we needed to be able to get up tomorrow without a hangover, we didn't end up buying it.

### Hanabi and sampling

After we've arrived back to our AirBnb, we totally forgot that there was something at Toji temple. We were too tired to go so we ended up chilling in the lounge and ended up watching random Japanese shows on the TV while we drank and played Hanabi (a card game). I don't think the others had the sufficient team skills to succeed at this game so I couldn't carry them to victory. We ended up losing all our games that night.

While playing hanabi, we sampled all the alcohol we bought that night and they were mostly good with some rancid ones that tasted real bad.

### Fushimi Inari Taisha

March 30th, 2023. We did it. We arrived at the place. The place that has visitors setting their display pictures to, while they're in front of the red torii gates. We'll complete Japan once we get a photo of ourselves in front of the gates. There's just one problem. There's too many people visiting the place at the same time as us.

The train ride to Fushimi Inari Taisha was packed and as I was walking, I was able to overhear comments from past visitors saying the number of people visiting was much larger than before. Jason, who had been here before, said that it was like double the amount of people.

As we got the entrance of the temple, we saw a huge crowd of people. All just waiting in line to go up the stair case and into the many torii gates. We ended up waiting in line to go in as well but as soon as there was a divergent path, we went there instead as not many people were there. I guess they all wanted to go on the main path.

This side path took us away from the many torii gates and led us to small shrines that's surrounded by greenery which included a bamboo forest. The path was quiet and we were able to explore and find different interesting sceneries. We figured we'll head back to the main path after it's quieter.

As we were exploring, we found a shrine that had a couple cherry blossom trees that shelter the shrine. The cherry blossom petals were dropping frequently from the tree so we spent some time trying to capture photos as the cherry blossom petals dropped on us.

We definitely weren't fabricating the above images by collecting petals from the ground and throwing the petals in the air as we took photos.

As we continued to explore, we found a staircase and not knowing where it took us, we followed it up. It was a bit of a hike that made our legs a bit sore. Near the end of the hike, we realised we arrived back to the main path and we are at the top of Mount Inari.

At the top, there wasn't as much people as we expected. Either the people that started with us had all arrived and went back while we were exploring or they gave up midway. The summit had a lot of statues, lanterns, and other items that don't seem out of place in a shrine.

We made our way down the main path. Stopping to check out any of the shrines that provided a break between the main path. One of the shrines had cats hanging out. Stephen managed to pet some but eventually led to them scampering away, to the disappointment of the other visitors.

While going down, we realised that the ascent on the main path might have been a bit difficult (though not as difficult as the side path we took since that was more steeper) and we were noticing the many of the Japanese visitors were wearing winter attire while they hiked up. We saw some winter coats and people wearing puffer jackets (ignore Stephen wearing the puffer jacket because that Kathmandu jacket is like his only jacket). The day started off a bit chilly in the morning but warmed up to be about 20 degrees in the afternoon. Guess people in Japan are more tolerant to the heat than us.

The entrance of the shrine surprised us since there were still so many people down there, we thought it was strangely quiet as we made our way down since we were able to get photos of just us in the main path.

### Kimono wandering

After the shrine, we headed for lunch in the city that's near the shrine. We had some soba and rice bowls with sashimi. It was pretty good.

We explored the city and came across some stores that were renting out kimonos. Figured why not, so long as it was the right price, we went looking around for places that were renting kimonos at an reasonable price. We didn't want to rent fancy kimonos for a lot of money.

After some time spent searching, we came across a place that was around 3000 yen per person, for a couple hours (I don't remember the exact price). The place had a bit of a line up but once it was our turn, we spent some time picking our colour choices before the shop assistants told us to get undressed to our underwear so they could put on the kimono for us. There were multiple layers to the kimono, there was a an inner layer that's not meant to be visible, an outer layer, and a jacket layer. It was a lot to wear and luckily it wasn't hot, otherwise it might have been torturous. Besides the layers, there were additional ornaments that were applied to bring everything together. Finally, we then get to choose a purse to take with us which allows us to put things in. We wore some tabi socks and had flat wooden sandals for shoes. Once the kimono was applied onto us, we left the shop to go explore.

We headed to Maruyama Park (I'm like 80% sure this is the place we went to). The park was setup to encourage people to visit for viewing parties. Food stalls, tables, and a lot of open areas for people to put mats down if needed. Like us, there were also a lot of people wearing kimonos there and wandering around looking at the cherry blossoms. At the park, we wandered around the place and took photos of us in different sections of the garden. We even managed to get a group of ladies to take a photo of the three of us together. 

We also came across more cats that approached us while we were sitting. As soon as the cats came, a whole bunch of people surrounded them and started petting them. Stephen wanted in and as soon as he approached, the cats ran off.

### Pontocho Alley and food

It was dark when we returned the kimonos so we started to look for dinner. I really wanted to check out Pontocho which is a narrow alley that had restaurants on the sides. However, when we got there, there were just so many people there and after reaching the end of the alley, we weren't really feeling like eating at any of the places because we were craving yakiniku. 

So we let Jason guide us to the a place and we encountered an all you can eat place that also served lemon sours. The place was alright in terms of food, but the lemon sours were real good and just being able to spam it was the best. One thing we've forgotten about Japan is that it's a cash society, so most places only accept cash. Unfortunately, this place only accepted cash so we had to send Jason to withdraw money and wait for him to come back to the place to pay. When visiting Japan, make sure you always have money in the pocket to pay, otherwise it might be awkward. Lesson learnt.
