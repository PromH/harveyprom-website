### Fukuoka pit stop
We got dropped off at the train station by Nakamura-san. Our next destination was a return to Fukuoka for a brief stop for lunch. We took a train to Fukuoka and it was cold in the morning so we wore warm clothes, which was a decision we regretted upon arriving to Fukuoka.

In Fukuoka, we went to some ramen place that served a unique ramen that used a tomato soup base. Getting there required a lot of walking and we were carrying our luggage along with our warm clothes which ended up just making it really hot getting to the place but worth it in the end since the ramen was really tasty and provided a different kind of ramen that we couldn't find elsewhere.

After lunch, we took another train to Hiroshima.

### The AirBnb
Hiroshima took a while to get to but once we've reached there, we had to travel to our AirBnb. We took a bus ride to get near the place. I believe that was also the bus ride where a Japanese kid took a picture of Stephen for some reason.

Once we got near our AirBnb, we got off the bus and walked the remainder there. Once we've arrived, we were a bit confused as to where it was since city areas are very dense and you can easily miss buildings. Took a bit of time but we've managed to figure out where it was but another problem, we had to take our luggage up to 5 floors and there wasn't an elevator. After justifying eating tasty foods, we've finally arrived to our room and one thing you really start to realise about Japan is that there isn't much space. Our AirBnb was so tiny. Bathroom was tiny, not enough room to put our luggage away from the door to our room, and bed was a single. Jason had an injured leg so he needed the bed, Stephen took the couch since he didn't really find the futons comfortable, and I took the floor using one of the rollup futons available.

True authentic Japanese experience we had.

### Dinner and evening stroll
We rested in the AirBnb, just using our phones while they recharged.

Once it was time for dinner, we began wandering around Hiroshima. Apparently Hiroshima is well known for their Okonomiyaki so we hunting for a place that served it.

Another thing we've noticed in some Japanese restaurants is that it's common to not see chairs for customers. It's common to see just elevated flooring with a mat on top that had a table in the middle. You were expected to sit cross legged or in seiza position (sitting on your knees).

We went to a place that served some. Very different to the ones I had in Australia and just so much better compared to the ones I had here in Australia. They used layered ingredients on top of one another instead of combining all the ingredients together.

After a satisfying dinner, we walked around to look for dessert. Ended up stumbling onto a dessert bar. The bar was manned by one old guy and the customers there just seemed to be old people in suits. Had cake and whisky there. Cake was pretty good but I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking for when drinking whisky so can't really comment on it.

Started to become late in the evening so there wasn't much we could do besides evening strolls, Stephen and I took our cameras and went walking and taking photos of random stuff while also experimenting with some random settings.

### Miyajimacho - First of the Three Views of Japan
Our next day in Hiroshima, we went to visit Miyajimacho which is located in a small island in Hiroshima. It is a very popular tourist destination and we reached it by ferry.

The most distinguishing feature of the island was the giant red torii gate that stood in the water. The island had so many areas to explore and I spammed my camera's shutter just taking as many photos of interesting things I could find, which was a lot.

There is a lot to cover so I'll just highlight things I've found interesting:

* The giant red torii gate that began its day surrounded by water but by the end of the day, the water went away so people were able to walk on the beach and take photos near it.
* Deers roamed the island and were very tolerant of people.
* A tall five tiered pagoda that was very impressive.
* There were cherry blossoms everywhere.
* Many different shrines and temples that you could go into and look at.
* There was a temple in the mountains that you could go for a bit of a hike so you can then look at different statues, monuments, and see the view of the island from above.


### Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum
Our final day in Hiroshima led to us having to carry all our luggage carefully down 5 floors. Our final place in Hiroshima ended up making us pretty down. The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum was confronting and it had a lot of tough images to see there but it was well presented that impacts you. Not much photos to share in the museum, just photos outside the museum. Would recommend visiting the museum unless you're not able to handle some disturbing images.

Our next destination was Osaka.
