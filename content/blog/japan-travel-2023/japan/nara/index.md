### Deer Park
Nara is an eastern city from Osaka that's a bit of a train ride away. However, the environment totally changes, with a more traditional vibe that has deers everywhere.

The deers in Nara were very familiar with people compared to the deers in Hiroshima that tended to be cautious of people. The deers learned to exploit people (especially tourists) into spending money to feed them with deer crackers. We fell into this category. The deers survey the area and monitor for people with deer crackers. Once they've targeted individuals, they'll begin with a casual approach to signify that they don't mean harm. A simple bow of the head is made by the deer and they'll expect a bow from their target. With the target under their control, the deer will now expect a cracker to be offered to it which it will then happily eat. Once eaten, the deer will now be lazy with bowing and do some shake of the head that can't be categorised as a bow. People will still reward it with crackers until they run out or refuse to give the deer anymore, in which case the deer will aggressively start performing an ocular patdown to see if there are still things to be eaten. Having chased the people away or satisfied with the outcome of the search, the deer will then stalk its next victim to scam.

We encountered a lot of deers in Nara and gave away many crackers to them, during our time there.

Nara hosts temples, shrines, and other buildings that we walked by when exploring Nara along with old statues and carvings that seemed to have been made many years ago. There was a walking path that showcased a lot of the attractions in Nara and the city really embraced itself as a deer park/city with deer statues, deer themed souvenirs, and food. A lot of nature blended with the man made pieces. Moss surrounded some of the older items, huge trees surrounded the paths to provide shade to them, and blooming trees and flowers provided contrast to some of the buildings.

### Traditional Mochi
Once we had our fill of Nara, we made a quick stop at a [place that was serving some traditional mochi](https://en.japantravel.com/nara/mochi-pounding-at-nakatanidou/20313). Long lines and a crowd surrounded the place since everyone wanted to watch it being made and grab some before it all ran out. We've managed to obtain some and it was tasty but not as sweet as I usually like. I enjoy the [mochis that can be obtained from Costco](https://www.costcuisine.com/post/costco-formosa-mochi-dessert-assortment-review) which is more sweeter and similar to a sweet but those mochis taste more artificial as well. The traditional mochi had a more reserved sweetness with the red bean paste inside with the outer layer being chewy with a unique flavour.


### Return to Osaka
We've returned [back to Osaka](../osaka/), after we got our fill of Nara.
