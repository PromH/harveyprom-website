### Arrival
Another 5ish hours of flying from Singapore and we've finally landed in Japan. However, it will take some time before we were able to get out of the airport.

They were doing some COVID checks and it was so confusing as to what they wanted us to do due to the language barrier and what the signs were saying. Basically, for people who are planning on going, you pretty much had to sign in and fill details about yourself and put in your COVID certificates with the following [website](https://www.digital.go.jp/en/services/visit_japan_web-en/) (The COVID part isn't necessary anymore from April 29th but prefilling the immigration and customs form is still really handy). We've filled it before hand but we didn't know we had to screenshot a picture of the QR code and present it to immigration. WiFi was awful there and we kept on regularly getting disconnected but we've endured and made it out!

Japan is so busy but the public transportation is amazing. We were able to catch a bus to the train station and then head out to Kumamoto on the JR line, after we got some food. The only issue was that we've made a bad choice of trying to redeem our JR Passes at a very busy train station. That ended up taking a couple hours unfortunately...

Our hosts also kindly let us know that there were no buses running from Kumamoto's train station to his ranch but luckily he was happy to pick us up for a small fee.
