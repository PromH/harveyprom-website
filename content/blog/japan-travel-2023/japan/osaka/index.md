### Dense City
It took a bit of a while on the train to get there but we've finally arrived at Osaka. It's quite a big city, filled with tall multi-leveled buildings and narrow streets that's populated with many people going about their day/evening.

We dropped our luggage at the AirBnb and then set out to look for dinner. Wandering around, we eventually encountered an izakaya that served a bunch of food and drinks. It was very smokey and cramped environment but at the same time, very chill and a relaxing environment. Had some horse meat which was interesting but definitely not the price we paid for, everything else was good.

We did some more night walking whilst randomly stumbling into an adult store by accident. We thought it just sold clothes and movies. We saw some old American movies being sold like The Terminator but as we kept on looking at the items, we started getting a bit suspicious. We saw books that on drawing the human body and other books with just partially clothed girls. We then noticed that there were more floors but the entryway before the stairs had a curtain saying `18+ only`. We didn't bother browsing the rest of the store that night since we were pretty tired so we went back to our AirBnb, which I should mention wasn't as cramped as the one in Hiroshima. It had three beds and space to put our luggage without it being in front of the door.

### Citying and window shopping
We had a bunch of time to kill the next day since we booked a couple of things to do in the evening. We headed out to explore the shopping district in Osaka, Namba and Tenma (I think?).

Along the way there, we had to go through the Kuromon Market which had a huge line of people waiting to be served sushi every morning. The line was so big that we didn't really want to wait that long so ended up just looking for a bit before heading to the districts.

We did a lot of looking around at anime items and one surprising thing about Osaka we've noticed is how much cheaper the anime items there cost compared to Tokyo. We say a newly boxed figurine (Makima from Chainsaw Man) selling for about ¥2,000 (about $21 AUD) in Osaka but Tokyo it was over double the price at above ¥4,000. So if you're ever looking to buy anime items, go to Osaka instead however Tokyo appears to have a wider variety of stores.

The arcades was also another area we've checked out there and it's amazing. Compared to the arcades here in Australia, there are multiple floors for different games where the first and second floor is usually reserved for gacha, claw machines, and other prize games. The other floors usually specialise in different subgenre of games like music/rhythm games on one floor, fighting games on another, racing games on the other, and many more genres that depend on the arcades. The arcade scene is unique where you'll a range of people from tourists, kids, college kids, and even see business people come here after work while just dominating on their favourite games. We really enjoyed some of the rhythm games that can't really be found in Australia (I did see one game in Melbourne's Fortress but it was just one out of so many).

### Osaka Aquarium
As it was nearing the evening, we headed out to the Osaka Aquarium since we had an allocated time booking. 

There were a lot of cool and interesting creatures on display there like rays, giant fishes with little fins compared to the size of the body, dolphins, long legged crustaceans, penguins, seals, and I think there was a whale there as well. The aquatic plants didn't really stand out to me so I mostly attention to the animals instead.

I especially enjoyed the jellyfish area with all the different jellyfishes. Some jellyfish exhibits had a mini vortex that just kept on spinning the jellyfishes around, not sure why but it was interesting to look at.

It was alright but I feel like there was a better aquarium in Australia (I think it was Sea Life Melbourne) that was a cut above in terms of showcasing the sea animals and environments. Osaka's aquarium was also so packed with people just crowding around the exhibit. You'd barely have a chance to see the popular animals since so many people would rush to the front.

### Reptile Cafe
It was also alright but food really sucks there. I got some bread with jelly and cream that costed a lot more than I would have liked to have paid.

### Hanging out with GT
We caught up with coworker from work. We'll call him GT.

We were wanting to go to a maid cafe that night however once we've arrived there, it was pretty much wrapping up with some maid doing a speech to all the current guests. We had GT ask if they're still opened (even though he can't really speak Japanese). He had to go back before 12am since that's when the last of the trains stop running so we ended up going back to that adult store we randomly found and continued our exploration.

It was real weird and also sound is playing for some floors which also leads me to another memory, there are so many floors with each floor focusing on different uhh adult things. Let's say that it's fun exploring and looking at the things that they were displaying.

I don't think you can randomly stumble into an adult store in Australia but turns out you can in Japan.

### [Day Trip - Nara](../nara/)
We made a day trip to Nara, which can be read about [here](../nara/).

### All you can eat yakinuku
It ended up being around dinner time when we've arrived back from Nara. Jason was the resident food guy for our group and suggested we try an all you can eat Japanese BBQ restaurant in Osaka that was rated really well.

On arrival there, it turns out that a lot of people had the same idea to go the place and we would have to wait an hour before we got seats.

We did some window shopping and wandering around in Osaka until it was time to return back to restaurant. We were all starving and hoping that the place was going to be worth the wait. It was definitely.

We were able to order so much food that also included unlimited drinks. We probably paid about 40ish AUD per person and we definitely were satisfied with the outcome.

Too bad I don't know the name of the place so I can't share it unfortunately.

### Sushi

Every morning whenever we've left our AirBnb, we are always seeing a huge lineup for sushi being sold at Kuromon market. The line was so long and always put us off from waiting for sushi.

However on our 2nd last day of Osaka, we noticed that the line was much shorter than the other mornings. Given that we have some time to kill, we decided to give it a shot.

We paid ¥10,000 (~$100 AUD) for a fresh and fatty cut of tuna meat that the chef prepared for us.

It was so worth it. The sushi just melts in your mouth and it's flavourful and fresh.

### [Day Trip - Himeji](../himeji/)

After the sushi, we ended up travelling to Himeji.

You can read about the trip to Himeji [here](../himeji/).

For dinner after Himeji, we had some ramen-like dish that didn't really seem like traditional ramen but still was quite tasty and filling regardless. We ordered it using a machine to pay for the order which gaves us tickets to give to the chefs to prepare.

### Don Quijote Dotonbori

After Himeji, Jason took us to a well known department store chain: Don Quijote Dotonbori. It's so well known that it even has it's own theme song. The store has sorts of items ranging from toilet paper to watches.

These items could be bought as duty-free items as well, but this visit to Don Quijote Dotonbori was just to buy alcohol which was so cheap compared to Australia. It's insane how much cheaper it is there compared to here in Australia.

After, we ended up exploring the city a bit in the evening and saw people busking. They got some small crowds going with songs but I didn't know what they were singing or if it was good so we just continued on.

### Setting out to Kyoto

Kyoto was our next destination and set out early to get there from Osaka.
