### Nakamura's Ranch
We met Nakamura-san near the train station where he helped load our luggage and take us to his ranch. He didn't speak much English but he used a translator that helped with the communication barrier. I was doing my best to talk Japanese with him since I was the only one that knew more than the random meme phrases. I didn't last long and pretty much exhausted my vocabulary after a couple of minutes. In the end, I've managed to introduced all of us, mentioned that I learnt and spoke a little bit of Japanese, we were from Australia, and respond to some of his questions. It's hard to translate what he was saying on the fly and then try to use the appropriate sentences to respond or ask. 

The drive to the ranch was really interesting, especially since that the scenario is different compared to Australia and even the cars are different as well. There are more box shaped cars, there were Japanese style trees and houses, and cars had TVs in them. We came during the time when Japan and the US were playing against each other in the World Baseball Classic so the TV in the car was pretty much just focused on that the entire time we were there.

When we arrived, we met Nakamura-san's wife and they helped prepare our rooms for us and showed us the main rooms that we'll be in. We then had a mini tour of the ranch where we got to see all the animals, feeding area, and garden. Nakamura-san made sure that we wore clean boots because of the foot and mouth disease pandemic that would affect cows. His ranch deals mainly with cows which are raised and then sold. Vegetables are grown there as well but we didn't look around too much there because it was raining at the time.

After that, Nakamura-san then dropped us off at an onsen where we had a hot bath there. Pretty much you had to be fully nude and wash yourself before going and relaxing in the hot spring bath there. It was so relaxing and then there was a cold bath area that people could go to as well to refresh yourself. It was such a relaxing experience and I highly recommend people to go out and try it (see this [guide](https://youtu.be/FdYiNdI2kPE?t=332)). I was so ready to sleep after that and the exhaustion of not having a proper sleep was catching up at the time however I was also hungry and dinner did not disappoint.

Once we've arrived back, the Nakamuras prepared a Japanese BBQ for us with a whole bunch of meat and vegetables with really delicious dipping sauce. We also had grilled taro with some sweet sauce. During this dinner, we chatted and talked about ourselves, what our plans in Japan, and learnt a bit about the Nakamura family. We learnt that we're the first Australian guests his family had over and that they visited Australia before many years ago. They often have guests from Japan or guests that come from Taiwan and China. They were also curious as to how we've discovered them and showed them [this website](https://en.stayjapan.com/area/kumamoto/aso/pr/1231) as well (which they didn't seem to have realised existed).

### Minamiaso Village
The next morning, we got treated to a traditional Japanese breakfast with a lot of different plates of food to eat from. There was miso soup with tofu, dried salted seaweed and fishes, pickled vegetables and fruits, salad, natto soybeans (I didn't really enjoy the texture of that), stir-fry, fried fish, rice, and cereal. It was so filling and I tasty. I enjoyed it a lot. Stephen for some reason decided to eat a whole pickled plum without rice... it was not a wise decision and it would haunt him for the rest of the trip.

After breakfast, Nakamura-san dropped us off at the community centre and helped with arranging bikes for us to rent out. They had e-bikes that helped with the pedaling but before that, we went shopping for food and drinks before departing. We didn't have all day to spend out since Nakamura-san was keen to show us the ranching experience so told us that he'll come back and pick us up later.

Once we got our bikes sorted, we looked to follow the road all the way to the hiking trail. However, it was not to be. Jason hasn't cycled in years so he wasn't too comfortable but we thought it would be fine with the e-bikes. The e-bikes probably made it worse since it's super easy to go at high speeds. We took off and cycled for about 10ish minutes before an accident occurred which injured Jason. A mud puddle caused Jason to lose control and fall off his bike, leaving his leg quite scraped. We managed to get some bandages and help him back to the community centre where his leg was properly disinfected and the staff there were very helpful (and apologetic for some reason even though it was our fault).

Jason managed to soldier on with his injury and was fine with walking once he got patched up. We ended up walking around and exploring the village and taking photos along the way. We had a map but we didn't know how to follow it so ended up scrapping it and making our own path. We followed the road and encountered some pretty interesting things such as greenhouses, shrines, abandoned cars, and a spring to refill your water. That spring had a lot of people come and go just to fill up their drinking water. The water was super clear and refreshing to drink as well.

### Ranch Experience
Once it was time to be picked up, Nakamura-san took us back to the ranch and gave a more in-depth tour of the place. We ended up feeding calves with milk, they were pretty energetic and kept running around inside their pen but warmed up once we began feeding them. We then went and fed the adult cows by first shovelling some grains(?) to them before rolling a haystack in front of them. We also took turns feeding the pony and goat that was there with carrots.

After that, we went on a drive up some mountains to the community meadow which housed some of his cows, along with cows that belonged to other farmers that were also using that meadow. He was able to call over his cows and introduce them to them us which was neat. Nakamura-san said that he had about 60ish cows and at different meadows.

As the evening approached, we headed back and had another bath at the onsen before having another delicious home cooked meal. This time we had grilled meat, stir-fried giblets, soup, and veggies.

### Farewells
We had our final traditional breakfast that they served. Didn't realise later that I would miss home cooked meals until later in the trip as well. Also Stephen still didn't eat the pickled plums and didn't finish some of the stuff.

During the drive, we asked Nakamura-san about what's happening after for them and it appears that their schedule is also pretty busy. They were making preparations for some other guests that will be staying over later in the day. He also said how his family was going to go on a family trip to Okinawa.

The view to the train station was so breathtaking with all the cliffs and bridges that were near mountains. It was so fascinating to see, especially since it's not often I see man made constructions that have placed in mountainous areas.

Really enjoyed the countryside of Japan and would love to visit there again and try hiking to different places there and look at the different scenery. A lot more greenery and colour that becomes lacking once you start heading entering the many urban cities in Japan (Looking at you Tokyo and Osaka).
