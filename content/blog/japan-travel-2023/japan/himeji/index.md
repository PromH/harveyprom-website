### Himeji Castle
Our second day trip from Osaka was at Adelaide's sister city: [Himeji](https://www.cityofadelaide.com.au/about-adelaide/sister-cities/himeji-japan/).

We took a bullet train there and as soon as we got onto the streets, Himeji Castle was the first thing that pops out. It was really tall and was pretty much at the centre of the city.

The castle was surrounded by water with bridges that connected to the entrance of the castle. Walls of stone further surrounded the castle and as we made our way into the courtyard, we saw so many cherry blossom trees and the place was filled with people gathering around and taking pictures.

During our time in Japan, we were playing find the American tourists since their accent is so distinct. We immediately encountered an American in outside of Himeji castle as we were lining up to take a photo. He was friendly and helped take a photo of the three of us together.

We spent some time just exploring the courtyard and garden sections that were outside of the main castle since the line to enter the castle looked massive. It didn't slow down. We ended up tagging along with the crowd to try to get into the castle before the closing times.

To get into the castle, you had to walk uphill and climb a bunch of stairs to reach the entry point. The walls of the castle looked to be in really good condition given its age and history. The walls even retained some spiked sections and openings to allow defenders to shoot attackers.

Once we reached the entrance, we all took off our shoes and made our way in. Inside was so narrow and cramped. The castle was designed for people who were shorter than us so we had to a lot of bending and crouching. We also had to a lot of climbing up these weird stairs while also being careful to not slip over and knock everyone back. Inside the castle, there were different collection of items and historical facts associated with them, like in a museum. Some parts were in English but most of it had a lot of Japanese text. 

The view from the castle was pretty amazing, you could clearly see a lot of the city as this castle seemed to be the tallest place in Himeji. This is also evident by the diorama of Himeji that's found at the highest floor of the castle.

We made our way done and out of the castle and explored more around it to take photos and see the different collection of objects in the past.

As the day started to draw to a close, we stopped at food stalls to get some street food for snacks before making our way back to Osaka.
