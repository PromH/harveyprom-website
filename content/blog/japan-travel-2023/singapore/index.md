### Early Departure
I don't think any of us managed to get much sleep and we had to wake up really early at dawn at 3am to get to the airport early. Too keen to finally begin our trip!

When we bought tickets, we didn't buy seats next to each other to save money and we've tried to change our seats for all our flights to be next each other. Only the Adelaide to Melbourne allowed us to sit next to each other.

It wasn't great being with this little amount of sleep. I was anticipating that I was going to get no sleep on the plane and not going to have a great time since I suffer from real bad motion sickness. So taking my motion sickness tablets and wearing my acupressure bands, I braced myself for the flights.

I kept constantly falling asleep due to the drowsiness and from boring movies that I was watching. Taking these motion sickness tablets helped me so much and added some drowsiness which made the plane bearable for once! Also, shoutout to noise cancelling headphones! They drown out a lot of the noise and helps the pressure in your ears making it extermely invaluable on the plane.

### No more planes for a while...
Finally landed in Singapore after constantly falling asleep during the plane ride. I had a great recovery and was able to get some sleep but Stephen and Jason had it pretty rough... they were seated near a baby that puked on the plane. So their area just stunk of baby vomit for the entire plane trip for them meanwhile I was just chilling at the front. I don't think they got much or any sleep at all...

We had a 10 hour layover in Singapore and we were meeting up with Stephen's Singaporean friend, Chingwen, who was keen on catching up and showing us around Singapore.

It took a while to get out of Changi airport because their form application for getting a temporary visa(?) sucked and didn't give you helpful errors that told you what was wrong with your form.

I've been to South-East Asian countries before and knew how humid and hot it was going to be there but I can never get used to being sweaty all the time. Outside, it was just raining and hot and it wasn't pleasant. I much rather 45 degree dry heat in Australia than 30 degree sticky heat.

We met up with Chingwen at Marina Bay Sans Singapore and spent time exploring the area and looking at bougie stores.

We then went walking around the nearby garden, Gardens by the Bay, there where we saw these weird towers that had plants around them with transformers nearby. There were so many people taking photos of it and I was one of those people.

We took a little dinner break before coming back to see the light show that was going on. It was pretty spectacle with lights changing colour based on the song that was playing at the time.

After that, we went exploring some more and took more photos around the city before parting ways with Chingwen.

With that, it is onto Japan... but it involves another plane ride as well.
