### The Long Wait

I've been wanting to go to Japan ever since graduating uni and having some disposable income. However, COVID decided to ruin two years of potentially travelling there.


### Learning

So in the meantime, I've been preparing myself by learning Japanese at [WEA](https://www.wea-sa.com.au/) (I highly recommend the language courses there). I did **Japanese For Fun And Travel** and **Japanese I**. I also did **French I** in between because I always wanted to learn French but anyways, my current progress is that I can ask simple questions and provide simple responses in Japanese now. I can also read hiragana and katakana (after doing some self study).

listening and speaking is still real rough. Speaking requires me to figure out how the sentence should be structured and if it makes sense to use. while also needing to remember the volcabulary as well. Listening is even worse since they speak so fast and I'm trying to interpret it to English on the fly but I do it too slowly.


### Opened Borders

While doing this learning and waiting, I've been trying to find people to go to Japan with. Some people had to change their minds due to other events that had planned for (which is understandable). Then there are some people who wanted to be invited by being asked directly where a message sent to a group chat with them in it wasn't satisfactory enough of an invitation for them. I'm not going to name names but this person knows who they are.

Anyways in mid September, the Japanese PM announced that their borders will be opened in October 2022. Exciting stuff so this led to us who are keen on going to Japan to organise and prepare tickets to go.

I spent a lot of time working on a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sXl3gYC8ZeWjZuWGpjnTzAWPfVCgZ7zYeqOGEUZRi3I/edit?usp=sharing) and populating it with information that I think would be useful. I think others found it useful when I shared it them as it gave them ideas and details on what would help with preparing for the trip.

Once planning has been sort of done, we ended up organising tickets, accomodations, and doing some reservations to places.

### Departure Looming

With the date for us to leave for Japan fast approaching, we spent our last couple remaining days packing.

Considering, that this was my first trip that's not with my family, I didn't really know how much I needed to bring along. So I just packing a ton of clothes and shoes. It ended up taking up all the space in my travel suitcase.

Packing went on for a while since I was constantly folding, arranging, and trying to figure out what to bring along. While this was all happening, I had Welcome to Wrexham in the background. Pretty good docuseries about Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds buying a club in Wales. You get to see the process and difficulty that comes with owning a club with its history.

I bought and was utilising packing cubes to its fullest here. I ended up having to remove some clothes since it took too much space. I struggled to pack my gifts that I brought back from Japan because it was still too much (still managed to fit most things in the end).

In the end, it was myself, Stephen, and Jason who ended up going to Japan in the end.
